AI Formula Scanner is a desktop AI formula recognition, analysis, and management tool. It supports region screenshots or image imports, one-click LaTeX extraction, and provides structured intelligent analysis and verification (with confidence scores). Built-in features include history and favorites, original image comparison, hotkeys, and bilingual interface.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

### Three-Stage Recognition Pipeline

The application uses 3 LLM calls for comprehensive analysis:

1. **LaTeX Extraction**: Extract LaTeX text from image only
2. **Intelligent Analysis**: Concurrent with the first call. Generate title, summary, variable table, glossary, and suggestions based on the image
3. **Verification & Confidence**: Starts after the first call returns LaTeX. Compare "extracted LaTeX + original image" to produce status (ok/warning/error), issue list, coverage, and confidence score (0-100)

### Processing Strategy

- **Concurrent Execution**: 1st call (LaTeX) and 2nd call (analysis) are triggered concurrently
- **Sequential Verification**: 3rd call (verification) starts after obtaining LaTeX
- **Real-time Feedback**: Recognition process is pushed to the interface with stage indicators, failed stages can be retried individually
- **Local Storage**: Recognition records (including original image path, LaTeX, analysis results, and confidence) are saved locally, supporting search, sorting, favorites, and detail drawer view
- **Model Calls**: Recognition relies on online LLM services (such as Gemini). First-time use requires entering a valid API Key in "Settings" and verifying connection through "Test"

## Notes üìù

### Model Recommendations ü§ñ

Note: Currently only supports Google Gemini API. ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Recommended model choices and typical processing times** (reference values, depending on network and image complexity):

- **Gemini-2.5-flash**: Optimal balance of accuracy and speed. Common formulas take about 10s, complex scenarios (including verification) overall experience about 20s
- **Gemini-2.5-flash-lite**: Faster and more economical, but slightly less accurate on complex formulas, can be used as a lightweight alternative

## Usage Workflow üß≠

### 1. Initial Setup

- Open the app ‚Üí Go to "Settings" page
- Enter API Key, click "Test" to ensure connectivity
- Adjust as needed: language (Chinese/English), screenshot hotkey, formula rendering engine (MathJax/KaTeX), and default LaTeX wrapper format

### 2. Start Recognition (choose one)

- **Screenshot Recognition**: Click "Screenshot Recognition" or use hotkey `Ctrl + Shift + A` to drag a box, release to start processing
- **Import Image**: Click "Import Image", select PNG/JPG/JPEG files to recognize

### 3. View and Edit

- **Progress Indicator**: Shows LaTeX ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Verification in sequence (can "retry" any stage)
- **Basic Page**: Preview formula, copy or edit LaTeX, expand original image comparison
- **Analysis Page**: View summary, variables (including symbols/units), glossary, suggestions, and verification report with confidence score

### 4. History and Favorites

- Recognition results are automatically saved to database
- In "History/Favorites" you can search, sort, view details (drawer style), support favorites and deletion

## Deployment Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

### Development Environment Setup üß∞
